## About Me

I am an international student from China. I am a driven and accomplished class of 2023 student at Lehigh University. Throughout my academic career, I have pursued a rigorous course in Finance and Business Information Systems, building a solid foundation of knowledge in both fields. I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and finance, and my academic interests reflect this passion. I have demonstrated a strong aptitude for programming, statistics, and data analysis and have explored various applications of these skills in finance. In particular, I am deeply interested in AI, Machine learning, algorithmic trading, and quantitative finance.
