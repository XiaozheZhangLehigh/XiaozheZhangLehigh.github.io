## About Me

I am a master's student in Mathematical Finance at Boston University, bringing a solid foundation in science and finance to my studies. I graduated from Lehigh University in 2023 with a dual major in Finance and Business Information Systems. I have demonstrated a strong aptitude for programming, statistics, and data analysis and have explored various applications of these skills in finance. In particular, I am deeply interested in algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, AI, and Machine learning.

_**[Analyzing Bank of the West Lending Practices](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/FinTech-Capstone-2023/?tab=readme-ov-file#executive-summary)**_

In 2023, following its acquisition of Bank of the West (BOW), Bank of Montreal (BMO) aimed to ensure equitable lending practices. The study assessed BOW's lending behaviors by analyzing 2021 loan-level data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and Census tract demographics for Arizona and California. Findings showed that BOW had fewer applications in high Black and Hispanic areas but lower denial rates than similar banks. In contrast, high Asian areas saw more applications but higher denial rates. The analysis provides insights for BMO Harris to serve underserved communities better.
