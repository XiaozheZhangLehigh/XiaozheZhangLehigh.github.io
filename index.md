## About Me

I am a master's student in Mathematical Finance at Boston University, bringing a solid foundation in science and finance to my studies. I graduated from Lehigh University in 2023 with a dual major in Finance and Business Information Systems. I have demonstrated a strong aptitude for programming, statistics, and data analysis and have explored various applications of these skills in finance. In particular, I am deeply interested in algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, AI, and Machine learning.
